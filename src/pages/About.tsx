                Hi my name is Nkosinathi and I do what I love. You might be curious why I chose<br />
                this field, well that's a bit of a long story but what I can tell you is, I've always been <br />
                fascinated by gadgets and how much impact they have in our lives generally.
              </p>
              <div className="text-xl font-light">
                From studying IT and having a passion for the visual arts, the migration through <br />
                self learning has been motivated by the drive to be among the best and well known<br />
                for their work. Every snap is my own interpretation of the moment and how I <br />
                choose to edit it. This is a journey that I enjoy and plan to stay on for a while.
