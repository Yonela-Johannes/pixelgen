                Hi my name is Nkosinathi and I do what I love. You might be curious why I chose
                this field, well that's a bit of a long story but what I can tell you is, I've always been
                fascinated by gadgets and how much impact they have in our lives generally.
              </p>

                From studying IT and having a passion for the visual arts, the migration through
                self learning has been motivated by the drive to be among the best and well known
                for their work. Every snap is my own interpretation of the moment and how I
                choose to edit it. This is a journey that I enjoy and plan to stay on for a while.
